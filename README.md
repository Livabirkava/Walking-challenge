This is my little app for tracking a daily walking challenge — simple, visual, and perfect for teams who want to stay consistent together. Everything updates in real time and saves automatically.
It lets me create teams, add people, and mark every day whether someone completed their walk. The app then shows team rankings, individual rankings, and progress across different phases. No spreadsheets, no chaos — just tap and go. ✔️

How it works: All data stays in the browser (localStorage), so nothing disappears after refresh.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/yourname/walking-challenge.git
cd walking-challenge
npm install
npm start
