This is app for tracking a daily walking challenge. It lets create teams, add people, and mark every day whether someone completed their walk. The app then shows team rankings, individual rankings, and progress across different phases.

How it works: All data stays in the browser (localStorage), so nothing disappears after refresh.

Installation:
git clone https://github.com/yourname/walking-challenge.git
cd walking-challenge
npm install
npm start
